## About the Project
This project is created for my Web Page Editing Subject at Obuda Univercity.
### Project Description
Writer's Home is intended to be a frontend design with content fetched as json from file( but later can be replaced with a good REST API for real dynamic content).

### Tools and resources
 - The choice of frontend framework is [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
 - For containerization I used [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - Based on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com) user [Tran Mau Tri Tam's](https://dribbble.com/tranmautritam) desgins.
